    <h1>About CossiePlay</h1>
    <p>

        CossiePlay is a family-run business, operating in Hulkstown since 2012. We create outstanding custom-made costumes. Cosplayers can order any kind of costume - from simple Spiderman or elf costumes right up to costumes including advanced features like armour, animatronics, realistic weaponry and working force fields. Depending on the difficulty, costumes take between 1 and 50 weeks and cost between $10 and $10,000.
        We buy and sell second-hand costumes (a price list is available) as well.
        On the first Saturday of every month we hold a “CossiePlay Party” at the town hall. Entry is $15 for adults, $10 for ages 6-17 and kids under 6 are free. Each entry includes one non-alcoholic drink and a glow stick. Parties start at 6pm and run until 11pm. There is always a live DJ at the party (who takes requests) and dancing is common (but not required).

    <p>

        The CossiPlay family is:
        Steven Rogers – Steve was a Navy Seal for 37 years before getting interested in hosting parties and helping people enyoj their fantasies together in a family-friendly fun environment.

        Sally Rogers – After only 6 weeks of her first dress-making course, Sally was already designing and sewing elaborate ball gowns and costumes that amazed her instructors. 10 years later and she’s making even more amazing creations for happy customers.
